## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract

In some companies with high security concern,it is important to keep all the communications within the company. This chatting software helps to achieve this by allowing peer to peer connection via IP address. It allows one to one chatting. Besides that, it has other features such as file transfering and chat history that would better help the employee during work.


### 1.2. Target Customer

Our clients include but not limited to companies and individuals.The software provide users secured communication and data transfering. Our direct customers are employees of companies and individuals.


### 1.3.	Search Words 
Chatting Application, Peer to Peer Connection, IP Connection, File Sending, hidden game


### 1.4.	Assumptions
  * The user has access to the internet and basic knowledge of internet technology.
  * Employee prefer chatting via the internet instead of face to face.


###1.5.	Scope and Objectives 
This software allow users to chat with others by knowing other person's IP address and port number. The primary usage of the software is one-to-one chatting. It also allows users to sent file to the other party. The chatting history would be saved, and users could access to daily chat log via a calendar. The software also support other thing such as hidden entertainment feature.

The design of the software is the following:

The main window is the chat window. It allows users to connect to other party by providing the other party's IP adress and port. When the other party is connected, both party could chat by typing into the text box. The user could also sent file to other party by pressing the attachment button. Lastly, the user could check past coversation by pressing the history button
