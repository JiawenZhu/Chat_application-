## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract

In some companies with high security concern,it is important to keep all the communications within the company. This chatting software helps to achieve this by allowing peer to peer connection via IP address. It allows both one to one chatting and also group chatting. 
It has other features such as file sending and chat log saving that would better help the employee during work.


### 1.2. Target Customer [LOOK LATER]

The client is companies with concern of their security.This software helps to keep the security while allowing their employees to have conversations with each other.Our direct customers are employees in the comapanies. They will use this for their daily conversations.



### 1.3.	Search Words 
Chatting Application, Peer to Peer Connection, IP Connection, File Sending

### 1.4.	Assumptions [NOT SURE NEED CHANGE]
  * There is multiples ports for connection.
  * Employee prefer chatting via the internet instead of face to face.


###1.5.	Scope and Objectives 
This software allow users to chat with others by finding other person's IP address. It allows for both one-to-one chatting and group chatting. It also allows users to sent file to the other party. Everyday, the chatting history would be saved as a .txt file where users could access to daily chat log via a calendar. The software also support other thing such as gaming.

The design of the software is the following:

The first window is the chat window. It allows users find other party via port and IP address by typing in the other party's IP adress and port. When the other party is connected,both party could chat by typing into the text box. The user could also sent file to other party by pressing the sent file button. Lastly, the user could check past coversation by pressing the Log button

This is the window that pops up if the user press "File" button in the Chat window. It allow users to find a file from directory and pick the file to open and sent.

This is the Calendar that the user could check the different logs saved in the different dates.This window would show up if the User press the log button.

The last part of the design is the rank board which ranks users with the rate. The techniques that we could use during the project include building up a database, connecting the database to the java program, coding the GUI of the software, and developing algorithms:

This is the easter egg window that would pop up if both party types in a command.Both party could play a simple Go game called Gomuku.

We would document the progress of our project through meeting minutes and work on each part of project on our own and share our code on the Github repository.
The priority task we have right now is to design a database that could hold the data and also designing the GUI of the software.

## 2.0	Team and Constraints

###2.1.	Team profile

* Rong Huang
  * Rong has taken CS1A,1B,1C,and Introduction to Database. As the project involved database,her experience in database would help.She could also help in coding the software from her experience in Java.

* Shuai Huang
  * Shuai has taken CS1A,B,C, and he has certainly the experience of GUI as he worked with Tianrong for the GUI project in CS1B. He is a fast learner too, as he thinks he is here to learn and cooperate.

* Jiawen Zhu(Evan)
  * Evan has taken CS1A,B,C, and he also has the experience of GUI as he participated in the project for CS1B. He is willing to coooerate with his teammates as well as put some good effect toward to the projects. He is also willing to learn SQL from other experienced team members. 

* Tianrong Xiao
  * He has taken CS1A, 1B, 1C, and he has good experience on Java, C++, and SQL. In addition, heâ€™s good at GUI design.




### 2.2. Constraints
* Non-Technical Constraints:
  *There is little time to fully develop to a grand project
* Technical Constraints:
  * We will use researched open source code and used it in our code
  *The software is developed using Java and thus can be run under any operating system

### 2.3. Challenges
* Design a connection tool to do peer to peer connection
* Design a calendar interface
