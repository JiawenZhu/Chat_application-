questions:
1.How to refer to the previous/next month on the current month?
Every month created will be stored into a list? 

2. each day on the Monthly Calendar should be a JPanel because it will store some text files? 
maybe just add some action on those day labels?

3. how to write the file in in Monthly_Calendar class?

4. all the calendars should be constructed beforehand? The file is added to the existing calendar.

all the calendars need to be constructed before users start to make conversation.

every time the user chooses the year, the calendar that is associated has been constructed beforehand.
after that, the file is added in. and then, user clicks the year to check for records in specific day.
